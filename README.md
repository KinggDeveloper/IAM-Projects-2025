# Identity & Access Management (IAM) Labs 
This is a collection of labs created to display hands-on Identity and Access Management (IAM) implementations using Entra ID, Active Directory, Conditional Access/Role-based Access, Federation, SSO, etc.

These labs serve as a track record of my practical experience and technical progression as I deepen my focus and knowledge within the Identity and Access Management domain, strengthening the skills needed to design, protect, and automate identity systems. In each lab I try my best to simulate real scenarios as best I can as if I were a hired-on IAM engineer/analyst working for a real company.

The labs will be setup by IAM and EntraID concepts just as I learned them so I can put what I learn into practice. So if your wondering how I apply RBAC i'll have a folder just for that.

### Whats my purpose of doing all this?
- Throughout the labs I want to exercise the knowledge I gained and put it into practice, such as IAAA, least privilege, governance, provisioning/deprovisioning, PowerShell automation, RBAC/ABAC, federation, etc. 
- I want this to be a place for individuals learning IAM, hiring managers, and recruiters to come and learn and see how I tackle certain identity situations and see what actual Identity and Access Management looks like in action.
